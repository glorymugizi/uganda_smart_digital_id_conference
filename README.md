> The project‚Äîbuilt at the conclusion of each module to put what was learnt to the test‚Äîis the first of the Microverse projects. It is constructed in accordance with the client's business requirements and is comparable to real-world tasks that one may be asked to complete. For this project, I created a smart ID summit that was centered on putting the finest technologies into practice in my nation in order to make it easier to identify people. Shin Cindy made the design template that was utilized on behance.net.
